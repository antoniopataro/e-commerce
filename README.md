# E-Commerce 🛒

This is my first NextJS project, a refactor of an old e-commerce I've made using React. Also first using `Typescript`. I wanted to test out my skills as a 3 month old programmer at that time.


## Technologies ⚙️

Used Typescript and @ts-ignore 🤣 on this project.

I created this project using `Vite` as its plugin. Chose `NextJS` as framework. It marks my first steps using `Typescript`, so it isn't that good on this matter.

Styled the project using `Styled Components`, used `UUID` for unique IDs for each product and `Redux` to manage shared states between components. A good choice due to this project's complexity.
